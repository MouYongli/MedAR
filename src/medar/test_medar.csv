rates of group b and c had been declining from period i to ii but the decline slowed down substantially even for every age class in periods iii and iv the incidence rates of groups d and e have been falling the incidence rate of the yearold age group has been increasing substantially the proportion of newly registered patients in group a to all patients of osaka city increased from in period i to in period iv the number of newly registered patients of the age class in group a accounted for of that in osaka city in period iv the slowdown in the reduction of the tuberculosis incidence rate has occurred not in all but in only a few wards and it is a typical phenomenon of the middleaged in those wards it would be worth investigating whether a substantial decline in the tuberculosis incidence rate in osaka city cannot be achieved by means of uniform control measures for all wards intensified tuberculosis control measures should focus on patients in specific wards and age CG
